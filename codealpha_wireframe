🚀 Wireframe Design for a Delivery App – Code Alpha Internship

📌 Project Overview
This project is part of my internship at Code Alpha, where I focused on User Interface Design by creating wireframes for a Delivery App using Figma. The goal was to design a user-friendly and intuitive app layout that enhances the overall user experience.

🎯 Objectives
Design a structured wireframe for a seamless delivery experience
Improve usability with intuitive navigation and clear layouts
Focus on user flow to ensure a smooth ordering process

🔧 Tools & Technologies Used
Figma – for wireframing and prototyping
UX Research – to understand user needs and pain points
Wireframing Principles – for clear hierarchy and layout planning

🛠 Design Process
User Research & Analysis – Identified user pain points & industry trends
Low-Fidelity Wireframes – Sketched initial layouts for different screens
High-Fidelity Wireframes – Refined the designs with better UI elements
User Flow Mapping – Ensured smooth transitions between screens
Iteration & Feedback – Improved designs based on feedback

💡 Learnings & Takeaways
Gained practical experience in UI/UX wireframing
Improved skills in user-centered design and problem-solving
Strengthened my ability to create intuitive and scalable app designs
